# Rock Paper Scissors AI

This is my solution to the **Rock Paper Scissors** project from freeCodeCampâ€™s Machine Learning with Python course.  
I implemented the AI logic inside `RPS.py`, where the program predicts the opponentâ€™s moves using patterns in their play history.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- AI opponent that learns from the playerâ€™s move patterns  
- Tracks wins, losses, and ties  
- Implemented in **Python 3**

---

## ðŸ›  How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors.git
   cd boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors

2.	Run the program:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py

ðŸ“Š Example Output


Final results: {'p1': 825, 'p2': 163, 'tie': 12}
Player 1 win rate: 83.50%
